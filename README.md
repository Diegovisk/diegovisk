## 🚀 Hello there! Welcome to my github 

My name is Diego Lucena and I am a 22 y.o. developer from Brazil.

Currently an undergratuate on Computer Engineering @ UEA. But also, always hungry for more knowledge or useful projects.

My specialty is web development, but I also have experience with desktop apps, mobile apps and general purpose scripts or tools for some Linux distros. Within a few years I wish not only to know a bit of everything on major areas of Computer Science, but also develop projects with IoT, start new open-source projects for my local community and engage in existing projects.

My main focuses at the momment are within the area of Data Science (with deep learning) and IoT.

### What I am currently working on:

- Data products development @ QuintoAndar, Brazil;
- Data science & IoT Research and development @ Ocean Manaus, Samsung/UEA.

### My research interests:
